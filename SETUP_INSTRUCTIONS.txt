SETUP INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING JAVA DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM WITH ANDROID APP
===============================================================================

To successfully run the Java distributed food ordering system with the Android application, 
the following 2 changes are required in the Java Application:

1. DOWNLOAD GSON.JAR DEPENDENCY
   - Download gson.jar from Maven Central
   - Command: curl -L -o gson.jar https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/code/gson/gson/2.8.9/gson-2.8.9.jar
   - Place the gson.jar file in the root directory of the Java project
   - This is required for JSON processing in the server components

2. UPDATE WORKER CONFIGURATION
   - Edit the file: Resources/WorkerConfig.json
   - Change all worker IP addresses from hardcoded IPs to localhost
   - Update each worker entry from:
     { "ip": "10.26.1.198", "port": "9001" }
   - To:
     { "ip": "127.0.0.1", "port": "9001" }
   - Apply this change to all 3 worker entries (ports 9001, 9002, 9003)
   - This allows the Master server to properly connect to locally running Worker servers

{
  "workers": [
    { "ip": "127.0.0.1", "port": "9001" },
    { "ip": "127.0.0.1", "port": "9002" },
    { "ip": "127.0.0.1", "port": "9003" }
  ]
}

AFTER THESE CHANGES:
- Compile: javac -cp ".:gson.jar:src" src/*/*.java
- Start servers in order:
  1. Master: java -cp ".:gson.jar:src" Entity.Master 0.0.0.0 9000
  2. Reducer: java -cp ".:gson.jar:src" Entity.Reducer 0.0.0.0 8080 0.0.0.0 9000
  3. Workers: java -cp ".:gson.jar:src" Entity.Worker 0.0.0.0 [9001|9002|9003] 0.0.0.0 8080
- Load data: java -cp ".:gson.jar:src" User.Manager 0.0.0.0 9000
- Android app connects to: 10.0.2.2:9000

These are the ONLY changes needed for Android-Java integration.
